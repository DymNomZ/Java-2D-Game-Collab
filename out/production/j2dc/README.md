Simple 2D Game made with friends just for fun and learning purposes.

**Notes:**
Dymes:
I'll put comments in lines that I wrote and end it with my name
i.e. //this here is foo_bar() it does things - Dymes
To compile and run at the same time do "java name.java"
Doing "java name" will run but not compile your latest changes
To compile only do "javac name.java"
