**Notes:**<br>

"So apparently File opening in Java dili mo work inig export to .jar<br>
According to StackOverflow, need nako e global variable <br>
That means na as of now, kay need pa ninyo e clone then run it that way<br>
I'll get it it to work, in the mean time inana lang sa inyo pag use." - Dymes<br><br>
