                Reply to Raymond:
                
                It's for instant healing. if healtime is 0, instant, so just return healamount. 
                for the else statement, i made a space for someone to implement 
                the "Heal over Time", and how to return it repeatedly 

                It might make more sense for consumeHeal() to manipulate the character's health
                over a period of time, rather than returning the healing the item performs.

                Suggesting an idea for Instant and Periodical Heal: 
                    1. Since character will be healed and damaged, there needs to be a manipulator method for the HP of the character.
                    2. HP manipulation method may be takeDamage() with hp -= dmg for both healing and damage;
                    3. For healing, pass a negative value to the manipulator function to increase HP.
